Implaturile dentare sunt niste suruburi de titan.

## Usage

To enable MathJax support be sure Kramdown is your Markdown flavor of choice and MathJax is set to true in your `_config.yml` file.

```yaml
markdown: kramdown
mathjax: true
```

```
Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]
```

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

The only thing to look out for is the escaping of the backslash when using markdown, so the delimiters become `\\[ ... \\]` and `\\( ... \\)` for inline and block maths respectively.
